<p class="discription">
    Homer Jay Simpson is a fictional character and one of the main characters of the American animated sitcom The
    Simpsons. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in
    The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt
    Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of
    shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the
    character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson
    family got their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. The show was later acquired by Disney in 2019.

    As patriarch of the eponymous family, Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa and Maggie. As the
    family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies many American
    working class stereotypes: he is obese, immature, outspoken, aggressive, balding, lazy, ignorant, unprofessional,
    and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he is fundamentally a good man and is staunchly
    protective of his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his
    life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in
    Springfield by himself, fighting former President George H. W. Bush and winning a Grammy Award as a member of a
    barbershop quartet.

    In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau; however,
    during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the
    expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons—including video
    games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books—and inspired an entire line of
    merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", has been included in The New Oxford Dictionary of
    English since 1998 and the Oxford English Dictionary since 2001.

    Homer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an
    American cultural icon. The British newspaper The Sunday Times described him as "The greatest comic creation of
    [modern] time". He was named the greatest character "of the last 20 years" in 2010 by Entertainment Weekly, was
    ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by TV Guide, behind Bugs Bunny, and was voted the greatest television
    character of all time by Channel 4 viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for
    Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and a special-achievement Annie Award. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded
    a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
